House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Tall Mike entered the pictured and killed Ned Stark and short Geoffry and ruled the kingdom for the next 1000 years. All hail Mike! All hail Mike!
